Note:  This driver requires the VISA and IVI libraries.       �    This class contains functions and sub-classes that configure the instrument.  The class includes high-level functions that configure multiple instrument settings as well as low-level functions that set, get, and check individual attribute values.
     T    This class contains sub-classes for the set, get, and check attribute functions.       �    This class contains functions that set an attribute to a new value.  There are typesafe functions for each attribute data type.     �    This class contains functions that obtain the current value of an attribute.  There are typesafe functions for each attribute data type.     �    This class contains functions that obtain the current value of an attribute.  There are typesafe functions for each attribute data type.    _    This class contains functions and sub-classes that control common instrument operations.  These functions include many of functions that VXIplug&play require, such as reset, self-test, revision query, error query, and error message.  This class also contains functions that access IVI error infomation, lock the session, and perform instrument I/O.
     R    This class contains functions that retrieve and clear the IVI error information.     ?    This class contains functions that retrieve coercion records.     J    This class contains functions that retrieve interchangeability warnings.     k    This class contains functions that lock and unlock IVI instrument driver sessions for multithread safefy.     F    This class contains functions that send and receive instrument data.    A    This function performs the following initialization actions:

- Creates a new IVI instrument driver session.

- Opens a session to the specified device using the interface and address you specify for the Resource Name parameter.

- If the ID Query parameter is set to VI_TRUE, this function queries the instrument ID and checks that it is valid for this instrument driver.

- If the Reset parameter is set to VI_TRUE, this function resets the instrument to a known state.

- Sends initialization commands to set the instrument to the state necessary for the operation of the instrument driver.

- Returns a ViSession handle that you use to identify the instrument in all subsequent instrument driver function calls.

Note:  This function creates a new session each time you invoke it. Although you can open more than one IVI session for the same resource, it is best not to do so.  You can use the same session in multiple program threads.  You can use the KESCPI_LockSession and KESCPI_UnlockSession functions to protect sections of code that require exclusive access to the resource.

    	J    Pass the resource name of the device to initialize.

You can also pass the name of a virtual instrument or logical name that you configure with the IVI Configuration utility.  The virtual instrument identifies a specific device and specifies the initial settings for the session.  A logical Name identifies a particular virtual instrument.

Refer to the following table below for the exact grammar to use for this parameter.  Optional fields are shown in square brackets ([]).

/*=CHANGE:===================================================* 

Modify the following default value so that it reflects the default address for your instrument.  You must make the corresponding change to the Default Value entry for the control.

 *================================================END=CHANGE=*/ 
Default Value:  "GPIB::14::INSTR"

Note: You specify the resource name with the "VInstr->" if you have the logical name that is the same as the virtual instrument name and you want to explicitly use the virtual instrument name. Otherwise, the driver uses the logical name.        Specify whether you want the instrument driver to perform an ID Query.

Valid Range:
VI_TRUE  (1) - Perform ID Query (Default Value)
VI_FALSE (0) - Skip ID Query

When you set this parameter to VI_TRUE, the driver verifies that the instrument you initialize is a type that this driver supports.  

Circumstances can arise where it is undesirable to send an ID Query command string to the instrument.  When you set this parameter to VI_FALSE, the function initializes the instrument without performing an ID Query.     �    Specify whether you want the to reset the instrument during the initialization procedure.

Valid Range:
VI_TRUE  (1) - Reset Device (Default Value)
VI_FALSE (0) - Don't Reset

    �    Returns a ViSession handle that you use to identify the instrument in all subsequent instrument driver function calls.

Notes:

(1) This function creates a new session each time you invoke it.  This is useful if you have multiple physical instances of the same type of instrument.  

(2) Avoid creating multiple concurrent sessions to the same physical instrument.  Although you can create more than one IVI session for the same resource, it is best not to do so.  A better approach is to use the same IVI session in multiple execution threads.  You can use functions KESCPI_LockSession and KESCPI_UnlockSession to protect sections of code that require exclusive access to the resource.

The format of this string is, "AttributeName=Value" where AttributeName is the name of the attribute and Value is the value to which the attribute will be set.  To set multiple attributes, separate their assignments with a comma.  

If you pass NULL or an empty string for this parameter, the session uses the default values for the attributes.   You can override the default values by assigning a value explicitly in a string you pass for this parameter.  You do not have to specify all of the attributes and may leave any of them out.  If you do not specify one of the attributes, its default value will be used.  

The default values for the attributes are shown below:

All Rights Reserved.    5"Simulate=0,RangeCheck=1,QueryInstrStatus=1,Cache=1"   �    This function sets the value of a ViInt32 attribute.

This is a low-level function that you can use to set the values of instrument-specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes.  If the attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs instrument I/O in the following cases:

- State caching is disabled for the entire session or for the particular attribute.

- State caching is enabled and the currently cached value is invalid or is different than the value you specify. 

This instrument driver contains high-level functions that set most of the instrument attributes.  It is best to use the high-level driver functions as much as possible.  They handle order dependencies and multithread locking for you.  In addition, they perform status checking only after setting all of the attributes.  In contrast, when you set multiple attributes using the SetAttribute functions, the functions check the instrument status after each call.

Also, when state caching is enabled, the high-level functions that configure multiple attributes perform instrument I/O only for the attributes whose value you change.  Thus, you can safely call the high-level functions without the penalty of redundant instrument I/O.

From the function panel window, you can use this control as follows.

- Click on the control or press <ENTER>, <spacebar>, or
  <ctrl-down arrow>, to display a dialog box containing a
  hierarchical list of the available attributes.  Attributes 
  whose value cannot be set are dim.  Help text is shown for 
  each attribute.  Select an attribute by double-clicking on it  
  or by selecting it and then pressing <ENTER>.

  Read-only attributes appear dim in the list box.  If you 
  select a read-only attribute, an error message appears.

  A ring control at the top of the dialog box allows you to see 
  all IVI attributes or only the attributes of the ViInt32 type.   
  If you choose to see all IVI attributes, the data types appear
  to the right of the attribute names in the list box. 
  Attributes with data types other than ViInt32 are dim.  If
  you select an attribute data type that is dim, LabWindows/CVI
  transfers you to the function panel for the corresponding
  function that is consistent with the data type.

- If you want to enter a variable name, press <CTRL-T> to change
  this ring control to a manual input box.

- If the attribute in this ring control has named constants as  
  valid values, you can view the constants by moving to the 
  Attribute Value control and pressing <ENTER>.

This is a low-level function that you can use to set the values of instrument-specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes.  If the attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs instrument I/O in the following cases:

- State caching is disabled for the entire session or for the particular attribute.

- State caching is enabled and the currently cached value is invalid or is different than the value you specify. 

This instrument driver contains high-level functions that set most of the instrument attributes.  It is best to use the high-level driver functions as much as possible.  They handle order dependencies and multithread locking for you.  In addition, they perform status checking only after setting all of the attributes.  In contrast, when you set multiple attributes using the SetAttribute functions, the functions check the instrument status after each call.

Also, when state caching is enabled, the high-level functions that configure multiple attributes perform instrument I/O only for the attributes whose value you change.  Thus, you can safely call the high-level functions without the penalty of redundant instrument I/O.

You can use this function to get the values of instrument- specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes.  If the attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs instrument I/O in the following cases:

- State caching is disabled for the entire session or for the particular attribute.

- State caching is enabled and the currently cached value is invalid. 

You must provide a ViChar array to serve as a buffer for the value.  You pass the number of bytes in the buffer as the Buffer Size parameter.  If the current value of the attribute, including the terminating NUL byte, is larger than the size you indicate in the Buffer Size parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

If you want to call this function just to get the required buffer size, you can pass 0 for the Buffer Size and VI_NULL for the Attribute Value buffer.  

If you want the function to fill in the buffer regardless of the   number of bytes in the value, pass a negative number for the Buffer Size parameter.

If the function succeeds and the buffer you pass is large enough to hold the entire value, the function returns 0.   

If the current value of the attribute, including the terminating NUL byte, is larger than the size you indicate in the Buffer Size parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

If the function fails for some other reason, it returns a negative error code.  For more information on error codes, refer to the Status return value control in one of the other function panels.

To obtain a text description of the status code, or if the status code is not listed below, call the KESCPI_error_message function.  To obtain additional information about the error condition, use the KESCPI_GetErrorInfo and KESCPI_ClearErrorInfo functions.

If the error description, including the terminating NUL byte, contains more bytes than you indicate in this parameter, the function copies BufferSize - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

If you pass a negative number, the function copies the value to the buffer regardless of the number of bytes in the value.

If you pass 0, you can pass VI_NULL for the Description buffer parameter.

If the user passes VI_NULL for the Vi parameter, this function clears the error information for the current execution thread. If the Vi parameter is an invalid session, the function does nothing and returns an error.
The function clears the error code by setting it to VI_SUCCESS.  If the error description string is non-NULL, the function de-allocates the error description string and sets the address to VI_NULL.

This function retrieves and clears the oldest instance in which the instrument driver coerced a value you specified to another value.

If you set the KESCPI_ATTR_RECORD_COERCIONS attribute to VI_TRUE, the instrument driver keeps a list of all coercions it makes on ViInt32 or ViReal64 values you pass to instrument driver functions.  You use this function to retrieve information from that list.

If the next coercion record string, including the terminating NUL byte, contains more bytes than you indicate in this parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

If you pass a negative number, the function copies the value to the buffer regardless of the number of bytes in the value.

If you pass 0, you can pass VI_NULL for the Coercion Record buffer parameter.

The function returns an empty string in the Coercion Record parameter if no coercion records remain for the session.

        Reports the status of this operation.

If the function succeeds and the buffer you pass is large enough to hold the entire coercion record string, the function returns 0.

If the next coercion record string, including the terminating NUL byte, is larger than the size you indicate in the Buffer Size parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

If the function fails for some other reason, it returns a negative error code.

To do so requires ensuring that each test module completely configures the state of each instrument it uses.  If a particular test module does not completely configure the state of an instrument, the state of the instrument depends on the configuration from a previously executed test module.  If you execute the test modules in a different order, the behavior of the instrument and therefore the entire test module is likely to change.  This change in behavior is generally instrument specific and represents an interchangeability problem.

You can use this function to test for such cases.  After you call this function, the interchangeability checking algorithms in the specific driver ignore all previous configuration operations.  By calling this function at the beginning of a test module, you can determine whether the test module has dependencies on the operation of previously executed test modules.

This function does not clear the interchangeability warnings from the list of previously recorded interchangeability warnings.  If you want to guarantee that the KESCPI_GetNextInterchangeWarning function only returns those interchangeability warnings that are generated after calling this function, you must clear the list of interchangeability warnings.  You can clear the interchangeability warnings list by repeatedly calling the KESCPI_GetNextInterchangeWarning function until no more interchangeability warnings are returned.  If you are not interested in the content of those warnings, you can call the KESCPI_ClearInterchangeWarnings function.

Before it does so, it waits until all other execution threads have released their locks on the instrument session.

Other threads might have obtained a lock on this session in the following ways:

- The user's application called KESCPI_LockSession.

- A call to the instrument driver locked the session.

- A call to the IVI engine locked the session.

After your call to KESCPI_LockSession returns successfully, no other threads can access the instrument session until you call KESCPI_UnlockSession.

Use KESCPI_LockSession and KESCPI_UnlockSession around a sequence of calls to instrument driver functions if you require that the instrument retain its settings through the end of the sequence.

You can safely make nested calls to KESCPI_LockSession within the same thread.  To completely unlock the session, you must balance each call to KESCPI_LockSession with a call to KESCPI_UnlockSession.  If, however, you use the Caller Has Lock parameter in all calls to KESCPI_LockSession and KESCPI_UnlockSession within a function, the IVI Library locks the session only once within the function regardless of the number of calls you make to KESCPI_LockSession.  This allows you to call KESCPI_UnlockSession just once at the end of the function.

Default Value:  None
    �    This parameter serves as a convenience.  If you do not want to use this parameter, pass VI_NULL. 

Use this parameter in complex functions to keep track of whether you obtain a lock and therefore need to unlock the session.  Pass the address of a local ViBoolean variable.  In the declaration of the local variable, initialize it to VI_FALSE.  Pass the address of the same local variable to any other calls you make to KESCPI_LockSession or KESCPI_UnlockSession in the same function.

The parameter is an input/output parameter.  KESCPI_LockSession and KESCPI_UnlockSession each inspect the current value and take the following actions:

- If the value is VI_TRUE, KESCPI_LockSession does not lock the session again.  If the value is VI_FALSE, KESCPI_LockSession obtains the lock and sets the value of the parameter to VI_TRUE.

- If the value is VI_FALSE, KESCPI_UnlockSession does not attempt to unlock the session.  If the value is VI_TRUE, KESCPI_UnlockSession releases the lock and sets the value of the parameter to VI_FALSE.
 
Thus, you can, call KESCPI_UnlockSession at the end of your function without worrying about whether you actually have the lock.  

Example:

ViStatus TestFunc (ViSession vi, ViInt32 flags)
{
    ViStatus error = VI_SUCCESS;
    ViBoolean haveLock = VI_FALSE;

    if (flags & BIT_1)
        {
        viCheckErr( KESCPI_LockSession(vi, &haveLock));
        viCheckErr( TakeAction1(vi));
        if (flags & BIT_2)
            {
            viCheckErr( KESCPI_UnlockSession(vi, &haveLock));
            viCheckErr( TakeAction2(vi));
            viCheckErr( KESCPI_LockSession(vi, &haveLock);
            } 
        if (flags & BIT_3)
            viCheckErr( TakeAction3(vi));
        }

     �    The ViSession handle that you obtain from the KESCPI_init or KESCPI_InitWithOptions function.  The handle identifies a particular instrument session.

Default Value:  None
    �    This parameter serves as a convenience.  If you do not want to use this parameter, pass VI_NULL. 

Use this parameter in complex functions to keep track of whether you obtain a lock and therefore need to unlock the session. 
Pass the address of a local ViBoolean variable.  In the declaration of the local variable, initialize it to VI_FALSE.  Pass the address of the same local variable to any other calls you make to KESCPI_LockSession or KESCPI_UnlockSession in the same function.

The parameter is an input/output parameter.  KESCPI_LockSession and KESCPI_UnlockSession each inspect the current value and take the following actions:

- If the value is VI_TRUE, KESCPI_LockSession does not lock the session again.  If the value is VI_FALSE, KESCPI_LockSession obtains the lock and sets the value of the parameter to VI_TRUE.

- If the value is VI_FALSE, KESCPI_UnlockSession does not attempt to unlock the session.  If the value is VI_TRUE, KESCPI_UnlockSession releases the lock and sets the value of the parameter to VI_FALSE.
 
Thus, you can, call KESCPI_UnlockSession at the end of your function without worrying about whether you actually have the lock.  

Example:

ViStatus TestFunc (ViSession vi, ViInt32 flags)
{
    ViStatus error = VI_SUCCESS;
    ViBoolean haveLock = VI_FALSE;

    if (flags & BIT_1)
        {
        viCheckErr( KESCPI_LockSession(vi, &haveLock));
        viCheckErr( TakeAction1(vi));
        if (flags & BIT_2)
            {
            viCheckErr( KESCPI_UnlockSession(vi, &haveLock));
            viCheckErr( TakeAction2(vi));
            viCheckErr( KESCPI_LockSession(vi, &haveLock);
            } 
        if (flags & BIT_3)
            viCheckErr( TakeAction3(vi));
        }

Error:
    /* 
       At this point, you cannot really be sure that 
       you have the lock.  Fortunately, the haveLock 
       variable takes care of that for you.          
    */
    KESCPI_UnlockSession(vi, &haveLock);
    return error;
