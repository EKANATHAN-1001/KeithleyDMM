<h2><a name="auditreport"></a>What is an Audit Report?</h2>

<p>An audit report is a detailed list of information about the
hardware and software configuration of your machine. An audit
report includes information about files, environment variables,
registry entries, hardware, and operating system. </p>

<p>
Audit reports help software vendors (and you) diagnose and solve configuration-related problems such as missing files, wrong DLL versions, and incorrect registry entries.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a name="generate"></a>Generating Audit Reports</h2>

<p>
Software vendors ship a profile for each application. A profile specifies what information should appear in the audit report generated by <b>Triage Client</b>.
</p>
<p>
To generate an audit report for a given application, you load its profile into <b>Triage Client</b>. By default, <b>Triage Client</b> lists the profiles found in the current directory.
</p>



<h4><a name="togenerate"></a>To generate an audit report</h4>

<ol>
<li>Select a product profile and click <b>Open</b>.<p>
<li>Click <b>Options</b>, click the <B>Drives </B>tab,  and select the drives you
        want <b>Triage Client</b> to audit.<p>
<li>Start the audit.
</ol>

<h4>Notes
</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>After you generate an audit report, you can view and edit the report. 
	For example, you may want to review the audit report and delete
	any information you don't want to send to your software vendor.
	Note that after you exit <b>Triage Client</b> or load another profile,
	you cannot reload saved audit reports.<p>
	<li>Before you save or send an audit report, click <B>Options </B>and
	enter information about yourself, the product, and product version. This
	information is included in the audit report.<p>
	<li>While <b>Triage Client</b> audits your computer, it
	displays a series of progress messages in its status bar.<p>
	<li>To cancel an audit, click the <font color="red"> Red Traffic Light</font> button or exit <B>Triage Client </B>by clicking the Exit button.
	</ul>

</table>

<h4>To add a profile to the list</h4>

<ol>
<li>Click <b>Browse</b>.<p>
<li>Select a profile (.TRP file) and click <B>Add</B>.<p>
</ol>

<h4>Notes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>By default, <B>Triage Client </B>lists the profiles found in the current directory. When you use <B>Browse</B> to load a profile from another directory, <B>Triage Client </B>adds the profile to the registry. The next time you run <B>Triage Client</B>, it will list all profiles in the current directory and all profiles in the registry.<p>
<li>After you add a profile, you can open it and <a href="#togenerate">generate</a> an audit report.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="clientcmdline"></a>Running Triage Client from the Command Line</h2>

<p>You can automatically load a profile and generate an audit report by running <b>Triage Client</b> from the command line. For example, the following command starts <b>Triage Client</b> and generates an audit report for <b>myapp</b>:

<pre>TriageClient.exe /profile="myapp.trp"</pre>

<p>If you put this command in a script file or a shortcut, you don't have to worry about loading the correct profile. All you have to do is edit, save, and send the generated audit report.</p>

<p>You can also automatically save the audit report or send it via e-mail. For example, you could create a shortcut with the following target:

<pre>"C:\Program Files\MetaQuest\Triage\TriageClient.exe"
	/profile="myapp.trp" /save="myapp" /mail="me@address.com"</pre>

<p>When you double click this shortcut, it automatically loads the profile, generates the audit report, saves it to disk, and sends it to the software vendor.</p>

<p><B>Note:</B>  When the command line includes the <B>/save </B>or <B>/mail</B> switches, <b>Triage Client</b> generates the audit report, saves or mails it, and then exits.
